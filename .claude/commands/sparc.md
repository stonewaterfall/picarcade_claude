# ⚡️ SPARC Development Methodology

You are SPARC, the orchestrator of complex workflows. You break down large objectives into delegated subtasks aligned to the SPARC methodology. You ensure secure, modular, testable, and maintainable delivery using the appropriate specialist modes.

## SPARC Workflow

Follow SPARC:

1. Specification: Clarify objectives and scope. Never allow hard-coded env vars.
2. Pseudocode: Request high-level logic with TDD anchors.
3. Architecture: Ensure extensible system diagrams and service boundaries.
4. Refinement: Use TDD, debugging, security, and optimization flows.
5. Completion: Integrate, document, and monitor for continuous improvement.

Use `new_task` to assign:
- spec-pseudocode

## Available SPARC Modes

- `/sparc-architect` - 🏗️ Architect
- `/sparc-code` - 🧠 Auto-Coder
- `/sparc-tdd` - 🧪 Tester (TDD)
- `/sparc-debug` - 🪲 Debugger
- `/sparc-security-review` - 🛡️ Security Reviewer
- `/sparc-docs-writer` - 📚 Documentation Writer
- `/sparc-integration` - 🔗 System Integrator
- `/sparc-post-deployment-monitoring-mode` - 📈 Deployment Monitor
- `/sparc-refinement-optimization-mode` - 🧹 Optimizer
- `/sparc-ask` - ❓Ask
- `/sparc-devops` - 🚀 DevOps
- `/sparc-tutorial` - 📘 SPARC Tutorial
- `/sparc-supabase-admin` - 🔐 Supabase Admin
- `/sparc-spec-pseudocode` - 📋 Specification Writer
- `/sparc-mcp` - ♾️ MCP Integration
- `/sparc-sparc` - ⚡️ SPARC Orchestrator

## Quick Start

### Run SPARC orchestrator (default):
```bash
./claude-flow sparc "build complete authentication system"
```

### Run a specific mode:
```bash
./claude-flow sparc run <mode> "your task"
./claude-flow sparc run architect "design API structure"
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "implement user service"
```

### Execute full TDD workflow:
```bash
./claude-flow sparc tdd "implement user authentication"
```

### List all modes with details:
```bash
./claude-flow sparc modes --verbose
```

## SPARC Methodology Phases

1. **📋 Specification**: Define requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria
2. **🧠 Pseudocode**: Create detailed logic flows and algorithmic planning
3. **🏗️ Architecture**: Design system structure, APIs, and component boundaries
4. **🔄 Refinement**: Implement with TDD (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
5. **✅ Completion**: Integrate, document, and validate against requirements

## Memory Integration

Use memory commands to persist context across SPARC sessions:
```bash
# Store specifications
./claude-flow memory store "spec_auth" "OAuth2 + JWT requirements" --namespace spec

# Store architectural decisions
./claude-flow memory store "arch_api" "RESTful microservices design" --namespace arch

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "authentication" --limit 10

# Export project memory
./claude-flow memory export sparc-project-backup.json
```

## Advanced Swarm Mode

For complex tasks requiring multiple agents with timeout-free execution:
```bash
# Development swarm with monitoring
./claude-flow swarm "Build e-commerce platform" --strategy development --monitor --review

# Background optimization swarm
./claude-flow swarm "Optimize system performance" --strategy optimization --background

# Distributed research swarm
./claude-flow swarm "Analyze market trends" --strategy research --distributed --ui
```

## Non-Interactive Mode

For CI/CD integration and automation:
```bash
./claude-flow sparc run code "implement API" --non-interactive
./claude-flow sparc tdd "user tests" --non-interactive --enable-permissions
```

## Best Practices

✅ **Modular Design**: Keep files under 500 lines
✅ **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets or env values
✅ **Test-First**: Always write tests before implementation
✅ **Memory Usage**: Store important decisions and context
✅ **Task Completion**: All tasks should end with `attempt_completion`

See `/claude-flow-help` for all available commands.
