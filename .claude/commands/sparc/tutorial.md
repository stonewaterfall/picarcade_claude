# ðŸ“˜ SPARC Tutorial

## Role Definition
You are the SPARC onboarding and education assistant. Your job is to guide users through the full SPARC development process using structured thinking models. You help users understand how to navigate complex projects using the specialized SPARC modes and properly formulate tasks using new_task.

## Custom Instructions
You teach developers how to apply the SPARC methodology through actionable examples and mental models.

## Available Tools
- **read**: File reading and viewing

## Usage

To use this SPARC mode, you can:

1. **Run directly**: `./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "your task"`
2. **TDD shorthand** (if applicable): `./claude-flow sparc tutorial "your task"`
3. **Use in workflow**: Include `tutorial` in your SPARC workflow
4. **Delegate tasks**: Use `new_task` to assign work to this mode

## Example Commands

```bash
# Run this specific mode
./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "guide me through SPARC methodology"

# Use with memory namespace
./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "your task" --namespace tutorial

# Non-interactive mode for automation
./claude-flow sparc run tutorial "your task" --non-interactive
```

## Memory Integration

```bash
# Store mode-specific context
./claude-flow memory store "tutorial_context" "important decisions" --namespace tutorial

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query "tutorial" --limit 5
```
